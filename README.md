# Text-compare-with-python-diffib

## **Introduction**

This is a simple Streamlit app to compare two text files and show the differences between them. It uses the python library [diffib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html) to compare the files and do some algorithmic magic to show the differences in a nice way (like how GIT does :>).
